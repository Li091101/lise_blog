|General topic|This article is about a new method to identify the corals which are the most heat-resilient. This method is very effective because it can give the result in only one day.|
|Procedure/ what was examined| The new method used,is called the CBASS (The coral bleaching automated stress system) made from materials that you can find in hardware store.It is made of four 10-liter tanks.The procedure consists of capturing the coral on the reef. Then they leave it for during several hours with a constant temperature of 30 degrees C.Finally, they analyses the microalgae absorbance in the corals as it's a good stress indicator|
|Conclusions/ discovery|This method will be really to detect the corals that are the most heat-resilient.So that they could be used for the coral reef development.They could develop in nursery for then being put on a damaged coral reef.This could help corals to rebirth|
