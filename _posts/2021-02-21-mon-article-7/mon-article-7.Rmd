|General topic|This article is about a new method for to identify the corals which are the most heat-resilient. This method is very effective because it can give the result in only one day.|
|Procedure/ what was examined| The new method used,it's the CBASS (The coral bleaching automated stress system) made from materials present in hardware store. Moreover, it is constituting of four 10-liter tanks.The procedure proceeds in captivating the coral on the reef. Then they let it alone while several hours with a constant temperature to 30 degrees C.Finally, they looked the microalguae absorbance in the corals because it's a good stress indicator|
|Conclusions/ discovery|This method will be critical in detecting the corals that are the most heat-resilient. Indeed, these corals can be used in nurseries and added to the damaged coral reef, allowing its rebirth.Since they are less vulnerable to the acidification of the ocean.|
