|Researchers?|Bernard Degnan, Russ Badcock and his colleagues|
|Published in? when (if mentioned)?|NewScientist, November 2 2020|
|General topic|This article speak about starfishs that are noxious for the coral reef because they eat the corals. Moreover, the starfishs predator are less plentiful because overfishing.|
|Procedure/ what was examined|For to reduce the starfishes the researchers think to two ideas :Firstly the researchers would like to spot the starfishes on the reef either diving or with robots.Even if the best would be to use the robots so they are going to concentrate on the starfishes culling.Secondly they have had idea of to control the starfishes from an early age. Moreover, the reseacher have discover that these release pheromones which can do to flee the other starfishes|
|Conclusions/ discovery|The coral reef are already touching due to the global warming and the other human actions like the overfishing which allow the starfish growth. Becasue of that the reefs are threatening because the starfishes feed them. So the biologists try of to find ideas for counter this phenomenom|
