|Researchers?|Buerger, Line Bay|
|Published in? when (if mentioned)?|Newscientist, September 18,2020|
|General topic|This article is about the corals resistance in relation to heatwaves. A gives solutions to save them|
|Procedure/ what was examined|Two researchers worked on two  different methods to help the corals to resist to heatwaves. First the Line Bay’s method which worked on assisted evolution. Then Patrick Buerger’s method which consists in working with algae which are symbiotic organisms. He wanted to create a symbiosis with algae which are more heat resistant|
|Conclusions/ discovery|We can help corals to develop thanks to genetic and symbiotic organisms such as algae|
|Remaining questions|/|
