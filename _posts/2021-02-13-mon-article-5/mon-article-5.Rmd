|Published in? when (if mentioned)?|ScienceDaily,December 10 2020|
|General topic|This article is about crabs use to eat the algae (or seaweed) which cover the coral reef. These algae prevent the correct coral development. Thanks to herbivore crabs there is a decrease of (less than) 50% of seaweed on the reef. |
|Procedure/ what was examined|Unfortunately, the Caribbean crabs aren't from Florida, so researchers have implemented a farming. Then, they put the crabs on the reef which was 80% covered by algae. After the crabs action the reef was only covered with 20% algae|
|Conclusions/discovery|Other organisms can be used for the coral development.In this case it's Caribbean crabs which help the corals to correctly grow because they feed on the algae which cover the coral reef and avoid their correct growth.|
|Remaining questions|/|
